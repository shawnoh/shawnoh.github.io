                    <p>Hello, my name is Shawn Oh. I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in 
                        Electrical Engineering at UCSD. I am currently looking for a career in the hardware or 
                        technology sector where I can expand my knowledge while contributing to the success of 
                        the organization. My experience with computers has fostered a passion for impacting 
                        the future through engineering.</p>
                    <p>This summer, I will be working as a RAMP Firmware Intern at Western Digital, in order to
                        acquire hands-on industry experience and broaden my engineering knowledge.
                    </p>

                <h2>Hardware Design</h2>
                <p>Working with hardware has been a passion of mine since my earliest years of youth. Starting off with simple 
                    electronics kits, I became familiar with simple circuits and soldering before entering high school. 
                    this inspired me to eventually pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering, and along the way I have built 
                    a large variety of hardware projects, ranging from embedded systems work on Arduino and ESP32 systems to more 
                    complicated designs such as control systems using PID. I have also used PCB design, Spice software, analog and digital design 
                    in my projects. In the future, I plan to expand my knowledge further 
                    and hope to be able to apply my experience to emerging computer technologies.</p>

                <h2>Software Development</h2>
                <p>Coding and programming started for me during my second year of high school, when I took my first introductory
                    programming class. It was here that I first learned about the endless possibilities with basic computer science,
                    and subsequently, the unfathomable diversity available by combining hardware and software experience. More recently,
                    I have used this experience to build a neural network from scratch using machine learning algorithms and non-linear algebra. I am well versed
                    in several languages, including Python, MATLAB, Java, C, and C++. For me, software development is primarily focused
                    in the machine learning field, one of my biggest interests for future career paths, and undoubtedly an industry which
                    will impact our future in large ways.

                <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
                <p>I have enjoyed expressing
                    my creative side through 3D modelling. Before I began using Blender, I had little to
                    no creative outlet, since I had never found much success in drawing, painting and the like. 3D Modelling
                    gave me space to tweak and perfect each of my scenes in such a way impossible before, and this has led me
                    to create some of the projects I am most proud about. My two main categories of modelling works are those focused
                    on photo- realism using more simplistic models but complex texturing, and those focused on extremely detailed models,
                    omitting texturing to let the small details shine. Though seemingly simple at first, I believe this medium of art can 
                    be used to tell a much more convincing story, with infinitely detailable work and modifications that other art forms may
                    not be able to support.

                <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                <p>My passion for 3D Modelling led me to a more career-related interest. Inspired by the widespread usage
                    of 3D printers in both high school and university, I acquired my own; by swapping from Blender to Fusion 360,
                    I was instantly able to physically manifest any design I could create. With this diverse skill set, I can create 
                    every part of my personal projects, from the plastic enclosures to the electronics and code. Knowing how to 3D model 
                    and print gives me the flexibility to design mounting brackets, robot chasses, mechanical gears, and even more. Just
                    like 3D Modelling, I can tweak my projects to exact specifications and improve my designs with every iteration. 
                </p>
                <p>Aside from my hardware projects, I have also used 3D printing to create special gifts for my friends and family, such as customized
                    keycaps with fitted latch-boxes.

                        In <a href = 'https://medium.com/applied-innovation-exchange/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-3f7e663c317a'> 
                        “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning”</a>, Toby Sakata argues that while AI and 
                        ML can have huge positive impacts on the world around us, it also has an equally massive potential to cause harm and cause
                        irreparable damage. Notably, Sakata cites that machine learning is being used to create tools that more accurately 
                        diagnose diseases, while also allowing hackers to discover and target potentially vulnerable victims through “smart” 
                        algorithms. Naturally, as machine learning has grown in impact and popularity hugely in the past few years, there are
                        thousands of articles talking about whether it will be a benefit or risk to humanity; however, I particularly like 
                        this article as it acknowledges both sides of the argument without pretending that they are not two sides of the 
                        same coin. 
                        <img src = './img/article_pic2.jpeg' class = 'article-picture-2'>
                        In particular, I think that there are a lot of news outlets causing the public to have a largely negative 
                        view on machine learning, notably with examples of “stealing data” on social media sites. Certainly, there is cause 
                        for concern in these areas, but all of ML and AI cannot and should not be captured with only these downfalls in mind.
                        As with any powerful advancement or technology, there will be positive and negative ways of using machine learning, and
                        it will be up to the authorities and developing engineers to limit how this technology is used (or abused). One of the
                        lessons emphasized in “big data” courses involving ML or AI is that the developers of such algorithms and programs
                        must be responsible for its potential impact on the world. Whether this is creating fake information or sowing
                            discourse with implicit discriminatory behaviors, there must be an understanding that, as a certain Spiderman 
                            once said, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

                    <p>Want to start your own programming journey? Start now with Python, a simplistic but powerful library- based coding language. 
                        While easy to learn, it is one of the most common languages used to program in machine learning due to its fast and 
                        convenient access to powerful public code libraries. <br><br>
