                    <p>Hello, my name is Shawn Oh. I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in 
                        Electrical Engineering at UCSD. I am currently looking for a career in the hardware or 
                        technology sector where I can expand my knowledge while contributing to the success of 
                        the organization. My experience with computers has fostered a passion for impacting 
                        the future through engineering.</p>
                    <p>Outside of my professional interests, I am an avid badminton player, rock climber and video gamer.</p>

                <h1>Hardware Design</h1>
                <p class= desc-text>Working with hardware has been a passion of mine since my earliest years of youth. Starting off with simple 
                    electronics kits, I became familiar with simple circuits and soldering before entering high school. 
                    this inspired me to eventually pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering, and along the way I have built 
                    a large variety of hardware projects, ranging from embedded systems work on Arduino and ESP32 systems to more 
                    complicated designs such as control systems using PID. In the future, I plan to expand my knowledge further 
                    and hope to be able to apply my experience to emerging computer technologies.</p>

                <h1>Software Development</h1>
                <p>Coding and programming started for me during my second year of high school, when I took my first introductory
                    programming class. It was here that I first learned about the endless possibilities with basic computer science,
                    and subsequently, the unfathomable diversity available by combining hardware and software experience. More recently,
                    I have used this experience to build a neural network from scratch using machine learning algorithms and non-linear algebra. I am well versed
                    in several languages, including Python, MATLAB, Java, C, and C++. For me, software development is primarily focused
                    in the machine learning field, one of my biggest interests for future career paths, and undoubtedly an industry which
                    will impact our future in large ways.

                <h1>3D Modelling</h1>
                <p>I have enjoyed expressing
                    my creative side through 3D modelling. Before I began using Blender, I had little to
                    no creative outlet, since I had always found drawing, painting and the like far too difficult. 3D Modelling
                    gave me space to tweak and perfect each of my scenes in such a way impossible before, and this has led me
                    to create some of the projects I am most proud about. My two main categories of modelling works are those focused
                    on photo- realism using more simplistic models but complex texturing, and those focused on extremely detailed models,
                     omitting texturing to let the small details shine.

                <h1>3D Printing</h1>
                <p>My passion for 3D Modelling led me to a more career-related interest. Inspired by the widespread usage
                    of 3D printers in both high school and university, I acquired my own; by swapping from Blender to Fusion 360,
                    I was instantly able to physically manifest any design I could create. With this diverse skill set, I can create 
                    every part of my personal projects, from the plastic enclosures to the electronics and code. Knowing how to 3D model and print gives me the flexibility to design mounting brackets, robot 
                    chasses, mechanical gears, and even more. 
                </p>
                <p>Aside from my hardware projects, I have also used 3D printing to create special gifts for my friends and family, such as customized
                    keycaps with fitted latch-boxes.
